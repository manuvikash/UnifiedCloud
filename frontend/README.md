## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Gladia API (for real-time speech-to-text)

## Speech-to-Text Feature

The chat panel now includes real-time speech-to-text functionality powered by Gladia's API. Here's how to use it:

### Features:
- **Real-time transcription**: Click the microphone icon to start recording your voice
- **Live preview**: See your speech being transcribed in real-time

- **Automatic integration**: Transcribed text is automatically added to the input field

### Setup:
1. The API key is configured in the env variable
2. The feature requires microphone permissions in your browser
3. Works with the existing chat functionality - transcribed text can be edited before sending

### Usage:
1. Click the microphone icon (ðŸŽ¤) in the chat input area
2. Speak clearly into your microphone
3. Watch the real-time transcription appear
4. Click the microphone again to stop recording
5. The final transcription will be added to your input field
6. Edit if needed, then send as usual
